# When Data Goes the Distance
Embark on an exploration of ultra running data with this PySpark project. Sprint through quirky metrics and discover the secrets of long-distance races. The project may not be perfect, but ultra races are.

**Project Overview**

In this PySpark project, I dive deep into the extensive dataset of ultra-marathon races, spanning an impressive timeframe from 1798 to 2022. The dataset, comprising a whopping 7,461,226 ultra-marathon race records from 1,641,168 unique anonymized athletes, offers a comprehensive and long-term perspective on this challenging sport.

**Motivation Behind Topic Selection**

As an passionate runner with over five years of experience, including participation in marathon and ultra-marathon distances, I bring a personal connection to this analysis. This project not only explores the technical aspects of PySpark and data analysis but also taps into my passion for long-distance running.

**Project Structure**

1. Exploring and Cleaning the Data

In this phase, I meticulously explore the ultra-marathon dataset, addressing data inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers. My goal is to ensure a clean and reliable foundation for subsequent analyses.

2. Performance Trends Over Years

This section focuses on uncovering trends and patterns in ultra-marathon performance over the extensive timeline of the dataset.

3. Athlete Demographics and Performance

Here, I delve into the demographics of ultra-marathon athletes and their correlation with performance metrics. At the same time, I am trying to add GDP data to the analysis.

4. Czech Races and Athletes

Given the global nature of ultra-marathons, this section narrows down the analysis to focus specifically on Czech races and athletes. 

**Future Developments**

This project adopts an "agile" approach, starting with basic analyses and gradually incorporating more advanced techniques. Recognizing the initial challenges in learning PySpark and Databricks, I plan to improve the project in future iterations. This includes fixing issues with the dataset, like missing information about race completion, and overcoming limitations of the Databricks Community Edition.

**Potential Future Topics:**

**Demographics and Performance Extension:** Further delve into the relationship between athlete demographics and performance, exploring additional variables and refining insights.

**Czech Races and Athletes Extension:** Expand the analysis of Czech races and athletes, potentially comparing them to global trends or exploring specific local dynamics.

**Continuous Refactoring:** Implement ongoing improvements, optimizations, and enhancements to ensure the project remains robust and aligned with evolving analytical standards.

By combining technical proficiency with a passion for ultra-marathon running, my goal is to provide valuable insights to both the data analysis and running communities.
